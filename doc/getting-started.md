The fastest way to try out Substance is running the SimpleWriter example editor.

You can clone the repository from Github.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/substance/simple-writer.git
```

Install the dependencies and start the development environment.

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

Now you can access the example at `http://localhost:5000`.

Once you have that working head over to create {@link your-first-editor}. To learn about how to integrate Substance into your development setup, see {@link integrating-substance}.
